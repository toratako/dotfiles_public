**Dotfiles for Arch Linux!**  

This is for my personal use, but useful as a reference.  
There are so many hardcoded literals. Be careful!  

By the way... let's grow your own dotfiles! It's so much fun :)  

## ⚒️ Installation ⚒️

You can easily deploy my dotfiles using [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/):

```shell
chezmoi init https://github.com/toratako/dotfiles_public --apply
```

Please refer [setup.md](./memo/setup.md) for more details.  

## 🗒️ License 🗒️

Except where otherwise noted, dotfiles are licensed under the Unlicense!
